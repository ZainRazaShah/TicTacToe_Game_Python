# TicTacToe_Game_Python
This is my first ever program that I wrote using Python. It is a simple Tic Tac Toe game designed for 2 players.

I have incorporated the following features in the game:

i)   Beautifully designed console-based game board using print statements. 
ii)  2 players can play it at a time.
iii) It checks for the winner after each turn.
iv)  It also checks if the game board is full & hence halts the match in case of a draw.
v)   The players can choose their markers between "X" & "O"
